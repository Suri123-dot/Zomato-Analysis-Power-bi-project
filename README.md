# Zomato-Analysis-Power-bi-project
Zomato project analyzing restaurant data globally: continents, costs, ratings, cuisines, drill-downs, filters, multi-page design for mobile + web.

## High-Level Steps
- Data import from multiple Excel files
- Data cleaning: fix city names, remove unused columns, split name/address
- Dim tables: extract cuisines, ensure unique CountryCode/Continent
- Build relations with correct cardinality & direction
- Geoâ€‘hierarchy & continent grouping

## DAX Measures
1. Total countries = DISTINCTCOUNT('Country Master'[Country])
2. Average rating = AVERAGE(KPIs[Aggregate rating])
3. Customer rating text = 
   SWITCH(
        TRUE(),
        KPIs[Aggregate rating] >= 4.5 && KPIs[Aggregate rating] <= 4.9, "Excellent",
        KPIs[Aggregate rating] >= 4.0 && KPIs[Aggregate rating] <= 4.4, "Very Good",
        KPIs[Aggregate rating] >= 3.5 && KPIs[Aggregate rating] <= 3.9, "Good",
        KPIs[Aggregate rating] >= 2.5 && KPIs[Aggregate rating] <= 3.4, "Average",
        KPIs[Aggregate rating] >= 1.8 && KPIs[Aggregate rating] <= 2.4, "Poor",
        "Not Rated"
   )
4.  Highest Average customer Rating = 
   MAXX(
        VALUES('Zomato global'[Restaurant ID]),
        CALCULATE(AVERAGE(KPIs[Aggregate rating]))
   ) 
5.  Restaurant Cost Rank = 
RANKX(
    ALL('Zomato global'[Restaurant ID]),
    CALCULATE(AVERAGE(KPIs[Average Cost for two])),
    ,
    DESC
)
